  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This is a delicious modification of a classic Thai dish! You've probably had the chicken version if you're a meat eater, and I'm sure you could substitute meat for the seitan, however, I urge you to give the seitan a try. Seitan is a meat substitute made from wheat gluten. Seitan comes the closest to real meat that a vegetarian or vegan can have. Seitan really picks up the flavor of whatever marinade it's put into. If you've ever had 'mock duck' at a Thai restaurant, then you've had seitan before. It can be found at natural food or Asian food stores.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger</li>
    <li>3 cloves galic, chopped</li>
    <li>1 teaspoons red curry paste</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can coconut milk, divided</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package chicken-style seitan, cut into strips or cubes</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons smooth peanut butter</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon tamari or soy sauce</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon chili garlic sauce</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon vegearian oyster sauce</li>
    <li>½ sweet onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 bunch fresh spinach, chopped</li>
    <li>4 green onions, chopped</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine the ginger, garlic, and curry paste in small bowl. Slowly pour in 1/4 cup coconut milk; stirring until the mixture is smooth. Gently stir in the seitan, coating the seitan with the marinade. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. The longer you let it soak, the more flavorful the seitan will taste! </li>
    <li>Stir together the remaining coconut milk, peanut butter, sugar, vegetable oil, tamari, chili garlic sauce, and oyster sauce in a medium bowl. Don't worry if it's not completely blended: when you cook it, the various substances will meld wonderfully. Set sauce aside. </li>
    <li>Lightly coat a large skillet with cooking spray; add the chopped onion; cook over high heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the onion is tender. Stir in the seitan, and cook until the seitan is heated through, about 7 minutes. Pour in the sauce, and stir to combine. Mix in the spinach and green onions; cook 3 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the spinach is cooked. </li>
  </ol>
