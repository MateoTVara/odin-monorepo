  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This General Tso's tofu recipe features crispy tofu coated in a spicy, sweet, and salty sauce. I'm not a vegetarian, but this is the best General Tso's dish I've had. I like to serve it over rice and garnish it with sesame seeds and green onions.</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h3>Tofu:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Sauce:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
    <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sambal oelek</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place tofu on a paper towel-lined plate with several paper towel layers; cover with paper towels and another plate. Set a 3- to 5-pound object on top plate; press tofu for 30 minutes. Drain and discard any accumulated liquid. </li>
    <li>Place tofu cubes in a shallow bowl. Add 2 tablespoons soy sauce and 1 teaspoon sesame oil; gently stir to coat. Let sit until tofu has absorbed most of the liquid, about 10 minutes. </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, whisk 3 tablespoons soy sauce, maple syrup, green onions, sambal oelek, rice wine vinegar, garlic, 2 teaspoons sesame oil, and 2 teaspoons cornstarch together in a bowl. Set sauce aside. </li>
    <li>Drain and discard any remaining liquid from tofu. Place 5 tablespoons cornstarch in a gallon-sized resealable plastic bag. Add tofu, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag; gently shake until tofu coated with cornstarch. </li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add tofu; cook for 4 minutes. Flip; cook until browned on all sides, about 4 minutes more. Transfer tofu to a plate; wipe the skillet clean. </li>
    <li>Add sauce to the skillet; cook until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Off heat, stir in tofu and toss to combine. </li>
  </ol>
